About me:
Currently, I am an FWF-Hertha Firnberg postdoctoral fellow at the Discrete Mathematics and Geometry group at the Technical University of Vienna in the Set theory group with the project (T 1100-N) titled Singular cardinals and cardinal characteristics (co-applicant Dr. Jakob Kellner). Before that, I held the same position at the Kurt Gödel Research Center for Mathematical Logic from the Mathematics Department of the University of Vienna with Vera Fischer as a co-applicant. I also held a postdoctoral position at the KGRC under the mentorship of Vera Fischer (February 2018-July 2019), Sy-David Friedman (October 2017-January 2018), and Lyubomyr Zdmoskyy (June 2017-September 2017).

My research interests deal with Set Theory, specifically forcing, cardinal invariants of the continuum, and its generalizations to the context of uncountable cardinals. In the last few years, I have been mostly focused on studying maximal independent families and the generalizations of cardinal characteristics to singular cardinals.
In June 2017, I finished my Ph.D. at the University of Vienna with a dissertation titled "Some cardinal invariants of the Generalized Baire Spaces" supervised by Professor Sy-David Friedman. The official version of the thesis can be found here. My previous studies in Mathematics were both done in Bogotá, Colombia at Universidad de los Andes (Master) and Universidad Nacional de Colombia (Undergraduate).
